A brief overview on how to use the slug programming language

## Declaring variables

Declaring variables is technically calling a function, but I will seperate it for clarity. There are three base datatypes in Slug, `int`, `float`, and `string`.

`int` is used for whole numbers, or integers.
`float` is used for numbers with fractional components.
`string` is used for words or letters.

## Base functions

`print` is the function that outputs to the console. It can either output a string literal, an `int`, a `float`, and a `string`. It automatically adds a newline to the end of what you give it.

## Examples

Here is an example program of the base datatypes and the print function


`print "Demonstrating the print and data types"`

`int inum 50`

`float fnum 35.4`

`string s "Hello World"`

`print "Printing an integer"`

`print inum`

`print "Printing a float"`

`print fnum`

`print "Printing a string"`

`print s`
